## 🌟 Overview

**Pojav Tier Tagger** pulls live ranking data directly from the MMPvP tier list and attaches a dynamic badge to every player in-game. The mod automatically calculates each player's highest-scoring gamemode and displays their tier alongside custom bitmap icons above player heads, in the tab overlay, and within chat channels.

Everything runs via asynchronous background polling, ensuring **zero impact on your frame rates or gameplay performance**.

---

## ✨ Core Features

* **🎛️ Universal Visibility:** Displays badges above player heads, in the tab list, and inside chat.
* **⚡ Smart Tier Calculation:** Automatically identifies and highlights a player's absolute best gamemode and rank without manual configuration.
* **🎨 Custom Icons:** Features custom bitmap font icons for all **8 supported gamemodes**:
  `Sword` • `Mace` • `SMP` • `Pot` • `Vanilla` • `NethOP` • `UHC` • `Axe`
* **⚙️ Mod Menu Integration:** Easily adjust display colors, refresh intervals, and surface visibility using an in-game config UI.
* **🔍 Instant Lookups:** Run `/pojavtier player <name>` for immediate on-demand player stat lookups.
* **🚀 Lightweight Engine:** Efficient background API polling keeps your game stutter-free.

This mod now builds as **12 separate jars**, one per Minecraft version from
`1.21` through `1.21.11` - see [`MULTI_VERSION_NOTES.md`](MULTI_VERSION_NOTES.md)
for how that's structured and built. Get the jar that matches your exact
Minecraft version.

3. From the [Releases](../../releases) page or the latest Actions build, download the `pojavtiertagger-<your version>-*.jar` that matches your Minecraft version, and place it in `mods`.

## 📜 Changelog

<details>
<summary><b>Multi-version restructure</b> (Current)</summary>

* **Restructured** into a multi-version build: `common/` holds the ~95% of
  the mod that's identical across Minecraft versions, and 12 small
  per-version modules (`versions/1.21` through `versions/1.21.11`) each
  supply only the handful of APIs that changed shape (font styling,
  keybinding construction, texture drawing). See `MULTI_VERSION_NOTES.md`.
* **CI** now builds and uploads a distinct jar per Minecraft version on every push.
* **Fixed:** gamemode icons rendering as missing-glyph boxes, and several
  config-screen buttons silently failing to appear - both traced to
  string-based reflection (`Class.forName`) not surviving Fabric Loom's
  remapping in production; replaced with direct, version-routed API calls.
* **Added:** a second, independently-configurable tier badge with left/right
  placement controls, and a live offline "mannequin" preview in the config screen.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>v1.21.11</b></summary>

* **Ported:** Updated target to Minecraft `1.21.11` (Fabric Loom `1.14`, Yarn `1.21.11+build.3`, Fabric Loader `0.18.1`, Fabric API `0.141.2+1.21.11`, Java `21`).
* **API Fixes:** Adapted to `GameProfile` accessor renames, `Style.withFont()` requiring `StyleSpriteSource`, `KeyBinding` category adjustments, and `CyclingButtonWidget.builder()` signatures.
* **Build System:** `fabric.mod.json` dependency ranges are now automatically generated from `gradle.properties` at build time.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>v1.0.1</b></summary>

* **Fix:** Resolved issue where gamemode icons defaulted to the sword emoji.
* **API Upgrade:** Switched to `/api/rankings` endpoint, parsing full per-gamemode `ranks` maps.
* **Syncing:** Synchronized gamemode icons and tier text calculations.
* **Commands:** Updated `/pojavtier player <name>` to return accurate point breakdowns.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>v1.0.0</b></summary>

* Initial release.
